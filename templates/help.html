              <br>
    		  <br>
              Coke Studios is a combination of virtual chat, music, and fun. When
              you register, you are taken to a page where you can customize your V-ego
              &#151; that becomes your digital self. This also becomes the picture
              you see on your Music Pass. Your V-ego represents how you will appear
              in the virtual world of Coke Studios. The virtual environment has public
              areas and personal areas (created by other users). It is really easy
              to move around when you enter Coke Studios. While you are in a studio
              just click a spot on the floor to move your V-ego to that spot. You
              can have a conversation too - just type in what you want to say and
              it appears in the bubbles above your V-ego. When chatting, you can select
              to speak normally and other V-egos up to 5 grid units away can hear
              you (see your bubble), or you can shout by moving the toggle button
              in the lower left of the screen and everybody in the room will hear
              (see your bubble).<br>
              <br>
              You can also:</span></p>





            <ul>

              <li><span class="copy">Dance by pressing the dance button.<br>

                </span></li>

              <li><span class="copy">See another V-ego's public profile by clicking

                on that V-ego.<br>

                </span></li>

              <li><span class="copy">Sit by clicking on the chair or couch you

                want to sit on.</span><br>

              </li>

              <li><span class="copy">Drink Cokes.<br>

                </span></li>

            </ul>





            <p class="copy">Now for the fun part. Once inside, find the studio

              mixers placed all over in the personal rooms or public locations on

              the map. Make your V-ego walk up to the studio mixer and mix some music

              (This is the same Mixer you&#146;ll find in &#147;Create Your Demo&#148;).

              Just follow the instructions and have fun. Make sure to burn a virtual

              CD of any music you want to keep. Your burned CD will show up in your

              backpack located at the bottom of your screen. Now you are ready to

              get out there and make the scene. With your CDs (you get 10 for free

              when you create your personal studio) you can go all over the virtual

              studio world and play your music for the masses. Why? If other users

              like your music, they can vote for you, and you earn decibels. You can

              even make copies and pass them to friends so they can perform your music.

              You use decibels to buy things in the virtual world of Coke Studios.

              You need decibels to decorate your own studio, buy furniture, pictures,

              etc. You can be a star, a producer, or a fan. It&#146;s all about fun.</p>
